/* SPACING UNITS
========================================================================== */
/*
* Try and use only these values to set typography spacing (margins) across site for consistency.
*
* $spacingBase is the same as default line height above. This value is then increased/decreased by halves.
*
* These values can be used in classes for tweaking spacing and are used in _base/helper-classes.scss
* styles for one-off use cases where an entire new class is not necessary

/* FONT-SIZE
========================================================================== */
/*
 * Create a fully formed type style (sizing and vertical rhythm) by passing in a
 * single value, e.g.:
 *
   `@include font-size(10px);`
 *
 * Thanks to @redclov3r for the `line-height` Sass:
 * twitter.com/redclov3r/status/250301539321798657
 *
 * Basically what this does is add font size (in rems) and if no line-height is declared
 * in the style you are creating, this mixin will create one that matches the
 * line-height applied to the body.
